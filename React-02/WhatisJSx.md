JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. It is commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX makes your React code more readable and allows you to use HTML tags and attributes to define the structure of your components.

Here's an example of JSX:

jsx
Copy code
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
Behind the scenes, JSX is transpiled into regular JavaScript using a tool like Babel.

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to use new JavaScript features before they are supported natively by browsers. It can also be used to transform JSX into JavaScript that browsers can understand.

For example, the JSX code:

jsx
Copy code
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
is transformed by Babel into:

javascript
Copy code
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
This transformation allows you to write modern JavaScript code, including JSX, and ensure compatibility with a wide range of browsers.
